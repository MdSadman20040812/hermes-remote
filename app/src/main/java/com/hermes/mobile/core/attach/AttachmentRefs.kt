/**
 * Finds files the PC is talking about inside ordinary message text.
 *
 * The agent has no file-attachment protocol; it says where a file is, in the
 * same formats the desktop already emits:
 *
 *  - `@image:D:/path/shot.png`   — how the gateway persists attached images
 *  - `@file:reports/q3.pdf`      — how `file.attach` refs are written back
 *  - `MEDIA:/abs/path/deck.pptx` — the desktop's "deliver this file" marker
 *
 * Inventing a sixth format would mean teaching the model something new and
 * breaking every transcript written before today. Reading the formats that
 * already exist means "send me the deck as a pptx" works with no server change:
 * the agent writes the file and names it, and the phone turns that name into a
 * real, openable, savable attachment card.
 *
 * A path that is quoted (backtick / single / double) round-trips: the gateway's
 * own `format_reference_value` quotes any value containing whitespace.
