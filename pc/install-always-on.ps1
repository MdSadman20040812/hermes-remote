.SYNOPSIS
  Make Hermes always-on: register the watchdog so the dashboard survives
  crashes, logouts, and reboots.

.DESCRIPTION
  Registers ONE scheduled task, "Hermes Always On", that runs
  `hermes-watchdog.ps1` at boot, at logon, and then every 2 minutes forever.

  Why a repeating check instead of a long-lived service:
  a supervisor process that loops can itself die, and then nothing is watching
  the watcher. A stateless check re-run every 2 minutes has no such failure
  mode - if a run crashes, the next one still fixes things. The check exits
  immediately when the dashboard is healthy, so the steady-state cost is one
  HTTP request to localhost every 2 minutes.

  Run as SYSTEM with -AtStartup so the dashboard is up before you log in, and
  keeps running after you log out.

.EXAMPLE
  # elevated PowerShell
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File D:\HermesMobile\pc\install-always-on.ps1

.EXAMPLE
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File D:\HermesMobile\pc\install-always-on.ps1 -Remove
